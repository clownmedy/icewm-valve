# icewm-valve

icewm-valve is a theme I made quickly as a test. The idea was to try to mimic the style of other similar existing themes for patched IceWM forks and xfce using the least amount of elements possible and only using standard IceWM, in short, keeping everything minimalistic and raw.
This will, by default, use the Tahoma font.

**DISCLAIMER:** I do not use **ALL** of IceWM features. Some colors were added blindly, replicating the structure of other basic IceWM themes. For example, I haven't checked the CPU or RAM meters since I only use the NET one, which is the only one I modified and properly tested. I'll probably fix it if the only person who sees and downloads this complains in 50 years.
